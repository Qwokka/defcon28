# Overview

This repository contains the supporting code and POCs for [Finding and Exploiting Bugs in Multiplayer Game Engines](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2028/DEF%20CON%20Safe%20Mode%20presentations/DEF%20CON%20Safe%20Mode%20-%20Jack%20Baker%20-%20Finding%20and%20Exploiting%20Bugs%20in%20Multiplayer%20Game%20Engines.pdf) at DEF CON 28

This is not the cleanest or most complete code I have ever written, but it should be helpful for interfacing with UNET and Unreal Engine 4's networking protocol.
